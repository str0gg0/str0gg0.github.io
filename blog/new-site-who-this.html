Well here we are, after another enormous hiatus and stretch of neglect I've decided to give this place a little TLC. Why the sudden change you ask? (and why did it take so long?) Well its all because of a little site called <a href="https://www.cohost.org">cohost</a> and how it changed my little corner of the internet for the better.
</p>
<p>
It was a little microblogging site that let users create long form posts with open CSS formatting. It sounds simple on the surface, and well it was (frustratingly so at times) but what made it incredible was its sense of community. For the first time in many years I was able to experience the internet as it should have been, microcosms of creativity, fun and friendship all orbiting and connecting with one another.
</p>
<p>Cohost was an online space that few knew they needed, until they found it.</p>
<p>Myself included.</p>
<p>
I made wonderful new friends, started new hobbies, saw new sites and started to come out of my shell for the first time in years. It got me out of my hedgehogs dilemma id found myself languishing in for so long, and did it with such a charming smile on its face.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m not one to gush on, so I wont, especially when <a href="https://ninecoffees.blog/lets-do-laundry-together-goodbye-cohost/">others</a> have <a href="https://blog.someplace-else.xyz/on-cohost/">done</a> a far <a href="https://blog.aurahack.jp/new-post/">better</a> job on reflecting what made it so special than I ever could.
</p>
<p>
So thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m back, its not just a coat of paint this time but a new emphasis to make this little space my own as I did on cohost. Because the internet needs to be small, fun and friendly again ðŸ’œ
