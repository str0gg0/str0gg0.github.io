I’m not dead! Ok, there were probably (defenatley) better ways to start this post with, but yes I am within the land of the living. So, so much has happened since that last post, I’ve reconnected with friends and family, jumped through some rather.. intense medical hoops, and hey I even got a job. So without further ado, here’s the latest status update of yours truly.
</p>
<p>
Firstly the wedding. If you’ve spoken to me in the last twelve months it would have only been a matter of time before I started talking about my friends wedding. I’ve known them for over a decade now, and last month they finally tied the knot as soulmates. It was an absolutely gorgeous day, and more than that was a wonderful time to reconnect with allot of friends I haven’t seen in quite some time. Change should always be expected, but it never fails to make me smile when I see what hasn’t changed. These little parts of ourselves we’ve carried since childhood, still there proudly on display only noticeable to people who’ve been around you half your life. I’ve been a bit of a hermit these last couple of years, and in a single day I felt all that shrouded loneliness fall off me, it was wonderful.
</p>

Onto weird gross body stuff. So, my abdominal cavity sprang a leak... again.. This time round the consultants weren’t having a bar of what A&E were telling them and they prepped me for surgery. Four hours later I woke up a good thirty eight grams liter having had allot of partial uterus stripped out, along with some other viscera. It was the least troublesome surgery I’ve had this year, and has left me with quite a bit of frozen tissue sitting in my freezer. My plan is to have it plastinated so I can keep it on my bookshelf like some sort of cursed curio, but tracking down a mortuary technician is proving tricky.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, that’s all for today’s episode, when I get some free time in December I’ll probably look at re-writing the site again. Other than that take care, be good, and hold on tight.
